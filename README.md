## About this project

We built this project using React Native CLI. We used technologies such as axious, react-reanimated, react-gesture-handler, react-native-navitagion, react-native-flash-message, among others.

During the development of this projects we used tools such as Reactotron and Postman to aid us spotting errors on the data handling. We were given a were given a free API hosted on heroku to use as our back end, but sadly mid development heroku stopped being free and from that point on we relied on a clone of the original API, which was missing some of the original endpoints and thus it required us to get creative and really use our tools to ensure what information was being sent and received.
